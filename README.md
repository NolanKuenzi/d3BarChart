==Description==

This bar chart displays the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the United States from 1947 to 2015. Each year is represented by four bars, one for each quater. The year 2015 is an exception, however, only the first three quaters of it are dislayed on this chart. Users can hover over any bar on the chart and see the exact GDP for the quater and the year that the bar represents.
